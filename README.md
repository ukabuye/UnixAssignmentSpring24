## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate various Unix commands and techniques for data exploration and wrangling. It covers a wide range of tasks, including data filtering, sorting, grouping, transforming and more. The examples provided here can be used as a reference for working with data in a Unix environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring and wrangling data using Unix, you will need a Unix-based operating system such as Linux or macOS. These systems come pre-installed with a suite of powerful command-line tools that can be used for data manipulation.

If you are new to Unix or need a refresher, there are plenty of online tutorials and resources available that can help you get up to speed. Familiarity with basic Unix commands such as `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, and `cut` will be beneficial.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the directories and files to find the specific data manipulation tasks you are interested in. Each example includes comments and explanations to help you understand the purpose and usage of the commands.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the data exploration and wrangling tasks covered in this repository:

- Filtering data based on specific criteria using `grep`.
- Sorting data by specific columns using `sort`.
- Extracting specific fields or columns using `cut`.
- Modifying data using regular expressions with `sed`.
- Performing calculations and transformations using `awk`.
- Aggregating and summarizing data using `uniq`.
